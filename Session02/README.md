# Practice Set
### Pascal's Triangle:
1.  Write a recursive and non-recursive implementation for getting arbitrary Pascal triangle numbers.  
<sup>n</sup>C<sub>r</sub> = <sup>n-1</sup>C<sub>r</sub> + <sup>n-1</sup>C<sub>r-1</sub>  
<sup>n</sup>C<sub>r</sub> = n! / (r! * (n â€“ r)!)  
2.  In both implementations, there are calculations that are being repeated. Can you avoid repeated calculations?
